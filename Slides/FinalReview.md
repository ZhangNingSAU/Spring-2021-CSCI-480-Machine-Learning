Hi guys,

In the final exam, you do NOT need to write any code. You only need to understand the basic machine learning concepts, terminologies, strategies, and techniques we learned in Chapters 1 to 10.
Here are some topics you may need to review.

# Chapter 1
+ Differences between traditional approaches and machine learning approaches?
+ Machine learning types
+ Challenges of machine learning

# Chapter 2
+ MSE(RMSE) VS. MAE
+ Use method in Pandas to show a summary of all numeric attributes
+ Correlation coefficient.
+ one_hot encoding for categorial attributes
+ How can we deal with missing values in the dataset?
+ Understand the training and test process.(we train the model on the training set and evaluate the model on test set.)

# Chapter 3
+ Differences between binary classification, multiclass classification, and multilabel classification.
+ confusion matrix
+ accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
+ ROC curve and AUC.

# Chapter 4
+ Differences between the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent.
+ Differences between Gradient Descent, mini-batch Gradient Descent, and stochastic Gradient Descent.
+ Differences between underfitting, fitting, and overfitting.
+ Differences between the loss functions of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regressions.

# Chapter 5
+ Definition of support vectors
+ Hard Margin classifiction vs. Soft Margin classification
+ Kernels/kernel trick

# Chapter 6
+ How a decision tree makes predictions.
+ Gini score and Entropy.(You only need to understand questions like this: given Gini scores of two nodes, which one is more "pure"?)

# Chapter 7
+ Definition of Ensamble Learning.
+ How a voting classifier make predictions.
+ Differences between bagging, boosting, and stacking

# Chapter 8
+ The curse of dimensionality
+ Given some pricipal components, how can we project the original dataset down to `d` dimensions.
+ How to choose the right number of dimensions.

# Chapter 9
+ How K-Means updates the centroids.
+ How K-means makes predictions.
+ Given a Silhouette analysis plot, you need to find out the optimal number of clusters.
+ Given the plot of a dataset, you need to figure out which clustering method should be used, K-Means or DBSCAN?

# Chapter 10
+ The main difference between traditional machine learning methods(what we learned in chapters 1-9) and neural network(deep learning).
  - Note: Does it need feature engineering or not?
+ Weaknesses of perceptrons
+ Which functions can be used as the activation function for neural networks with backpropagation? Which can not?
+ Differences between sequential models and non-sequential/complex models in keras
