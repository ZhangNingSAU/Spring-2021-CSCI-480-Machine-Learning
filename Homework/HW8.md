# CSCI480 Spring 2021
# Homework 8 for chapter 10
# Due: 11:59pm 05/07/2021
# Q1. Design and test a deep learning model on the MNIST dataset.
Note: 
1. Use all the 70,000 data points.
2. Use 60,000 data points as the full training set, and 10,000 as the test set.
3. Split the full training set to create the training set(55,000 data points, used to update the parameters), and a validation set(5,000 data points)
4. You can design your own neural network(the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, the activation function, the optimizer, and any other hyper-parameters. You can also use either a sequential model or non-sequential model)
5. Let's take this homework assignment as a `CONTEST`, the one who has the highest accuracy on the test set will get 10 points as bonus! The one with the second highest will get 5 points.


# Step 1: Please complete Q1.

# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework8_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
