# Homework 0
# Due: ASAP
# Q1: Install Python
+ One tutorial link was provided in Section 1, [Chapter 0](https://github.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Slides/00_Python_Basics.ipynb).
# Q2: Install Jupyter Notebook
+ One tutorial link was provided in Section 2, [Chapter 0](https://github.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Slides/00_Python_Basics.ipynb).

Note: If the content of jupyter notbook file **00_Python_Basics.ipynb** does not show up, you can use the nbview to see it. Here is the link to nbview. https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

# Q3: Create a ipynb file

![newipynb](../Resources/HW0-newipynb.png)

Note: 
+ When you click on **New**, you will see a list of kernels. Python3 is the default kernel, while others are user-defined. For example, MachineLearning is the one I defined for this course. You just need to choose the default one: Python3. 

+ If you need to download and use the ipynb files(the lecture slides), you can
  - go to https://github.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Slides
  - choose the file you need to download, for example 00_Python_Basics.ipynb
  - click on Raw
  
  ![raw](../Resources/HW0-raw.png)
  
  - save the page(You can also use shortcut ctrl+s(windows) or cmd+s(mac))
