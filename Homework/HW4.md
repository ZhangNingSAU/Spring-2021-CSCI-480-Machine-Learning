# Due: 11:59pm 03/26/2021

# Q1: Generate an artifical dataset based on the following model.

$$y = 1 + 2 \times x_1 + 3 \times x_2$$

# Q2: Design and train a binary classifier to predict even-number or not-even-number.
# Q3: Design and train a multiclass classfier to predict the digit is less than 3, between 3 and 6, or greate than 6.

# Note:
+ Use accuracy as the metric in Q2.
+ Use precision and recall/sensitivity as the metrics in Q3.
+ Use F1-score as the metric in Q4.
+ Use cross validation for one model(you can choose any one).
+ Bonus: Plot the ROC curve and cacluate AUC for the binary classification model in Q2(10 points).
+ Bonus: Error analysis for the multiclass classification model in Q3(10 points).
+ Execute your code before the submission.

# Step 1: Please complete Q1-Q4
# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework3_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
