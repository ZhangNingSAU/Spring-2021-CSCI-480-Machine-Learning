# CSCI480 Spring 2021
# Homework 6 for chapters 6 and 7
# Due: 11:59pm 04/16/2021
# Q1. Train and evaluate a decision tree model on Iris database.
+ Note:
  - use all the 4 features.
  - split the dataset for training and test.
  - visualize the decision tree and save the picture(it woulb be great if you can show the picture as well).


# Q2. Train and evaluate ensemble models on the [HW2_Student_Scores_Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/main/Resources/hw2_student_scores.csv).   
+ Note:
  - this is a regression problem. you may need to do some research on VotingRegressor and BaggingRegressor.
  - for the basic predictors, you can choose any predictor(s) that work for the problem.
  - three models: voting, bagging, and boosting.
  - for voting, you can choose either soft or hard voting.
  - for bagging, you can choose either bagging or pasting.
  - for boosting, you can choose either adaboost or gradient boost.

# Bonus question(15 points): Use rondom forest to evaluate the feature importances of [HW2_Student_Scores_Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/main/Resources/hw2_student_scores.csv).

# Step 1: Please complete Q1-Q2.

# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework6_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
