Q1. Train and test your ML model for the [HW2_Student_Scores_Database](../Resources/hw2_student_scores.csv)
+ This is a database I created for HW2 based on the [Student_Scores_Database](../Resources/student_scores.csv) we used in [Chapter 1](../Slides/01_The_Machine_Learning_Landscape.ipynb)
+ The new database contains two attributes **Hours and Gender**, and the output/response variable is **Scores**.
+ **Gender** is a categorial attribute.
+ **Hours** column contains a few missing values(np.nan).
+ Following the end-to-end project in [Chapter 2](../Slides/02_End_to_End_ML_Project.ipynb) to design your ML model for this dataset.
+ At least, you need to provide the following parts:
  - load the data
  - take a look at the data structure
  - create training set and test set
  - visualization
  - data cleaning for numeric attribute(s)
  - handling with the categorical attribte(s)
  - choose and train your model
  - test your model
+ Bonus(15 points)
  - provide feature scaling(5 points )
  - create a pipeline (10 points)
# Step 1: Please complete Q1
# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework2_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
