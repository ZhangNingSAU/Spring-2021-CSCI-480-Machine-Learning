# CSCI480 Spring 2021
# Homework 7 for chapters 8 and 9
# Due: 11:59pm 04/30/2021
# Q1. Design and test a PCA model on Iris database.
## Step 1: Load the Iris database(all the 4 features)
## Step 2: Use PCA to get all the PCs(principal components)
## Step 3: Use the first two PCs to project X onto a 2-dimensioan space and do the visualization.
## Step 4: Use the `explained variance ration` to choose the right number of PCs.
  + Use 95% as the threshold.

## Step 5: Choose a classfier model, compare the performance of the model you choose on the original dataset and the new dataset with lower dimensionality.
+ Note:
  1. Split the dataset into training set and test set.


# Q2. Train and evaluate KMeans models on the dataset [HW7_Q2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/main/Resources/hw7_Q2.csv).   
+ Note:
  - 1. Find the optimal number of clusters.
  - 2. Visualize the clusters you find.


# Step 1: Please complete Q1-Q2.

# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework7_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
