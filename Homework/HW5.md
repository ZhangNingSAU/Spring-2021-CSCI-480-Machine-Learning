# CSCI480 Spring 2021
# Homework 5
# Due: 11:59pm 03/31/2021
# Q1. Design and train SVM classification models to predict the digit is an even-number or not-even-number in MNIST dataset.
+ Note:
  - build three models: linear svm, polynomial kernel svm, and RBF kernel svm.
  - use 60000 data points as the training set and 10000 as test set.
  - use sensitivity to evaluate the model.
# Q2. Design and train a SVM regression model to predict the scores in [HW2_Student_Scores_Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhangNingSAU/Spring-2021-CSCI-480-Machine-Learning/main/Resources/hw2_student_scores.csv).   
 

# Step 1: Please complete Q1-Q2
+ Note:
  - better to design a pipeline for each model.
+ Bonus(10 points):
  - use cross-validation for one of your models.
# Step 2: Please save the answers in a Python Jupyter notebook file, name it as "CSCI480_Homework5_JohnDoe(0123456).ipynb", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/webapps/login/)
+ Note: in the .ipynb file, if you need to provide some comments or explanation for your work, you need to change the type of the file to Markdown. Here is the [basic syntanx for Markdonw](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
